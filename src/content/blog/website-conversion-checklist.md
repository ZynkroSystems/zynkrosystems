Your website might look great, but if it’s not converting visitors into leads, it’s just a digital business card — not a sales engine.  
This checklist will help you spot the most common conversion killers and fix them fast.

---

## 1. ✓ Your Headline Passes the 5-Second Test

Visitors should instantly understand what you do and why it matters — within five seconds of landing.

**Check:**  
Can a complete stranger read your headline and know what you offer?

**Fix:**  
Lead with results, not services.  
✅ “Never Miss Another Customer Call” beats “Business Process Automation Solutions.”

---

## 2. ✓ One Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)

Too many CTAs confuse people — and confused visitors don’t click.

**Check:**  
Is there one obvious next step (like “Book a Free Audit”) that stands out on the page?

**Fix:**  
Make your primary CTA bright, bold, and benefit-driven. Avoid generic text like “Submit.”  
✅ Use: *“Get My Free Audit”* or *“Start Saving Time Today.”*

---

## 3. ✓ Visible Trust & Social Proof

People buy from businesses they trust — so prove you’re credible.

**Check:**  
Do you have testimonials, Google reviews, or client logos visible above the fold?

**Fix:**  
Add authentic reviews, customer photos, or “as seen in” logos.  
Even a short quote from a happy client builds trust instantly.

---

## 4. ✓ Fully Mobile-Optimized

Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. If your site doesn’t load perfectly on phones, you’re losing leads daily.

**Check:**  
Is text easy to read? Are buttons large enough to tap? Does your form work smoothly?

**Fix:**  
Design mobile-first. Test on multiple screen sizes.  
Small frustrations = big drop-offs.

---

## 5. ✓ Speed Under 3 Seconds

Speed directly impacts revenue — every extra second can cut conversions by up to 7%.

**Check:**  
Use [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test your site. Aim for a score above 85.

**Fix:**  
Compress images, remove heavy plugins, and enable caching.  
Fast sites build instant trust.

---

## 6. ✓ Contact Info is Always Visible

Buy-ready visitors shouldn’t have to search for your details.

**Check:**  
Is your phone number in the header or footer on every page?

**Fix:**  
Add a sticky “Call Now” or “Book a Free Audit” button.  
The easier you make contact, the faster conversions happen.

---

## 7. ✓ Simple, Logical Navigation

If users can’t find what they need in two clicks, they leave.

**Check:**  
Are your menu items clear and limited to essentials (Home, Services, Case Studies, Contact)?

**Fix:**  
Avoid dropdown clutter. Use short, descriptive labels like “Our Work” instead of “Portfolio.”

---

## 8. ✓ You Handle Objections Early

Your website should answer questions before people ask them.

**Check:**  
Do you clearly explain pricing, timelines, or guarantees?

**Fix:**  
Add an FAQ or “Why Choose Us” section.  
Transparency builds confidence and removes hesitation.

---

## 9. ✓ You Offer a Value Exchange (Lead Magnet)

People rarely share their email “just to stay updated.”  
Give them something worth exchanging it for.

**Check:**  
Do you offer a free guide, checklist, or audit that solves a real problem?

**Fix:**  
Use your expertise. Offer a *Website Audit* or *Automation Playbook* — something instantly useful.

---

## 10. ✓ Analytics Are Set Up and Checked

You can’t fix what you don’t measure.

**Check:**  
Are you tracking conversions, form submissions, and traffic sources?

**Fix:**  
Install **Google Analytics 4** and **Meta Pixel**, and use **Hotjar** or **Clarity** for heatmaps.  
Data tells you what’s working — and what’s not.

---

## 🔥 Bonus: Use Heatmaps to See What Users Actually Do

Heatmaps and session recordings show where visitors click, scroll, and drop off.  
Tools like **Hotjar** or **Microsoft Clarity** give you a front-row seat to your customer’s experience.

---

## Your Website Conversion Action Plan

1. **Audit** – Score each checklist point (1–10)  
2. **Prioritize** – Fix what hurts conversions most  
3. **Test** – Make one change at a time and measure  
4. **Optimize** – Keep improving based on real data
