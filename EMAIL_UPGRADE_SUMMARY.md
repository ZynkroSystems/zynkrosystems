## Environment Variable

Make sure you have `RESEND_KEY` set in your Vercel environment variables (looks like you already do!).

## Optional: Update Your Resend Domain

When you're ready, update line 52 in `api/contact.ts`:
```typescript
from: "ZynkroSystems <leads@zynkrosystems.com>", // Change from onboarding@resend.dev
```

You'll need to verify your domain in Resend first.

## Test It!

Fill out your contact form and check your inbox. You should now see a beautifully formatted, branded email with all the information cleanly organized! ðŸš€
